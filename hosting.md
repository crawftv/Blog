# Hosting

## Why host your own website?

I think everyone should run the server for their own website. This sentiment is a little controversial.   
The first reason is that there really is no better option if you want to run data-intensive applications. Many alternatives I have tend to crash at any reasonable price point, especially if you want to show off more than one project. Also working in the AWS system can be a nightmare. I had error after error deploying something to Elastic Beanstalk. 

Self-hosting all your projects gives you greater control over everything.

Eventually... it just works.  

## Digital Ocean

I used digital ocean because the tutorial on the site was in-depth and it worked for me.
