# Pip-tools for Cross-OS development.

## Problem Definition

I am using Prefect.io for a project. 

## Components

### Pip-tools

The pypi package you will need to make this all work. 

### Requirements.in

List all your top level dependencies here. Anything you would manually install goes here. i.e. `pip install pandas scikit-learn`

### Requirements.txt

The requirements.txt is generated by the pip-tools command `pip-compile`

## Steps

### 1 . pip-compile 

```text
pip-compile requirement.in --output-file=requirements.txt
```

This step gets all the top level dependencies, anything you would manually install for your project.

### 2. pip install

```text
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
