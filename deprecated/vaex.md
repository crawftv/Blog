# Vaex

## Why Vaex?

I am tempted to start using only vaex from now on. The api is very close to pandas. But it enforces some better habits. The code lightning fast. 

The vaex state object basically records all your operations and can turn them into a pipeline \(similar to scikit-learn's make pipeline\).
