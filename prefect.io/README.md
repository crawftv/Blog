# Prefect.io

## Why Prefect and not Apache Airflow?

Honestly, I main chose it because the docs looked better and someone in my class made a contribution to project. Another more important reason is that small tasks seem easier with Prefect. I have a relative simple ETL job to run daily. I was able get the core operation running relatively quickly and the scheduler was also very easy to get started.
